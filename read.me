This was a small project for the university. The code had to meet the following conditions:
- No libraries could be used: for this reason the code was not split.
- The code must be written with the basic concepts of the language: Only variables, data types, cycles and functions are allowed.
This is a small calculator with the basic operations between matrices that works through the command console.
